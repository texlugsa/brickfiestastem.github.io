    <li>~8:45 Meeting Adjourned

    <li>After Brick Fiesta STEM, Inc, Board Meeting, TJ Avery made two requests via email:
            <li>REQUEST 1: Can someone please capture this where it's supposed to go? (see my notes below) I think we have something in the BF Google account, like a document somewhere in Google Drive.
                    <li>For future requests: Go to the drive.google.com under "board" logged in as webmaster@brickfiesta.com
            <li>REQUEST 2: Also, can someone add Mark to the brickfiesta-board Google Group? He's not on it. The group was created by a Brick Fiesta account (i.e. someone will have to log into the Brick Fiesta account, go to the Google Groups page, and then add or invite Mark).
                    <li>For future requests: Go to groups.google.com under my groups BrickFiesta Board logged in as webmaster@brickfiesta.com, Manage group, Members, Direct Add Members
    
    <li>Chris MacDougald, Webmaster Extraordinaire took the responsibility to fulfill the two requests.  Mark Kunetz was added and a new document with the meeting minutes has been created and the notes copied.  For future meeting minutes need to follow Roberts Rules for meeting minutes (part of being a board in Texas is you have to follow this and report them publicly http://brickfiestastem.org/ was registered for this purpose) see previous years for future examples.
